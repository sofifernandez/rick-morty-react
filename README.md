# This is Riggity Wrecked, son! :wine_glass:

A personal project to expand my portfolio using React and this amazing [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) created by Axel Fuhrmann. You can find the deploy [here](https://riggity-wrecked.netlify.app/).

A little backstory...
I am a Microbiologist :microscope: from Uruguay, but I have always loved computers and IT. It all took off when I had to analyze microbiota data for my PhD, there was no going back after that. And here we are. Huge Rick and Morty fan over here.

## Let's do this :muscle:

_You can get a local copy of this project and use it for developing purposes or whatever you want. You are going to need an editor (like Visual Studio Code), NodeJS and Git._

### Also, here are some libraries :books:

Sass@1.43.4 --> [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension language

React-router-dom@5.3.0 [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/) - Dynamic routing

### Clone it from GitHub :hammer_and_wrench:

_"Oh no... We've been cloned!"_ :bust_in_silhouette::bust_in_silhouette: (guess the movie).

    git init
    git clone https://github.com/sofifernandez/rick-morty-react.git
    npm install
    npm start
